# HLSL mode for Emacs

inspired from glsl-mode, version 0.1. Working with shader mode 6.0.

I followed the Li-Xah tutorial on how to create Emacs major mode [here](http://xahlee.info/emacs/emacs/elisp_syntax_coloring.html). There are probably better ways doing major modes than syntax tables. Problem is that we can't directly using cc-mode which will trigger a lot of errors.
